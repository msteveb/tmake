Add support for per-directory rules. Probably need something like Jam's <grist>

Read project.spec and build.spec in subdirs

Have a 'tmake -init' which will generate stub Makefiles

Allow detection of build rule dependencies (project.spec, build.spec, settings.conf)
and reload rules.

Work out a good arrangement for the distribution of:
- low level rules
- high level rules
- default rule base
- local customisations

How to add rules for new Object types?

Add parallel build support.

Better debug levels

Support Test, Publish

Add getopt and use it like automf for Executable --test --install=/blah ...

Do proper getopt processing in tmake

Use source location even when unable to build something to show what rules
were used to determine that something was needed. Perhaps look back along
tmake(current). This is done, but could be formatted better.

Add a version number

Add user errors and internal errors like autosetup
