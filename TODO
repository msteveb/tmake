Add support for per-directory rules. Probably need something like Jam's <grist>

Read project.spec and build.spec in subdirs

Have a 'tmake -init' which will generate stub Makefiles

Allow detection of build rule dependencies (project.spec, build.spec, settings.conf)
and reload rules.

Work out a good arrangement for the distribution of:
- low level rules
- high level rules
- default rule base
- local customisations

How to add rules for new Object types?

Add parallel build support.

Add -q to quit after the first failure.

Better debug levels

Support Test, Publish

Add getopt and use it like automf for Executable --test --install=/blah ...

Do proper getopt processing in tmake
- --debug, --verbose, etc.

Use source location even when unable to build something to show what rules
were used to determine that something was needed. Perhaps look back along
tmake(current)
