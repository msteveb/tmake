----------------------------

This is a cmake example from http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CMake:How_To_Process_Lots_Of_Input_Files
converted to tmake.

Converts all files in the current directory named *.in to the corresponding
file without the ".in" extension using the generated app, processor.

This Works
----------
* Out-of-tree builds (on by default)
* Use --build=. for an in-tree build
* To use the generator from other directories, add "Executable --publish"

Issues
------
* If cross compiling, the processor will not work (needs HostExecutable)
* Currently "Depends" is not local-aware. It should be.
