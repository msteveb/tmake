Two phony targets (actions) also exist\nwhich can set a specific configuration. It is now possible to set\nthe configuration and rebuild with the command line:\nIt might be desirable for the single action to both update the configuration\nand rebuild, i.e. tmake default. One way to do this may be with a recursive invocation of tmake:\nHowever this is cumbersome and inefficient. A better way to achieve this\nis to have the rule re-add a new target.\nIn this case, once the rule has run, a new target is added\nto the build, as if added on the original command line.\nIf the target was already on the command line, this has no effect.\nSee also:\n"});
