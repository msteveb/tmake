Any change in timestamp is considered a change).\ntmake provides both hash-based and time-based comparisons as suitable for the project.\nHash-based comparison vs Time-based comparison can be enabled with UseHashes on|off\nin project.spec, or tmake --hash (for testing) . The default is time-based comparison.\n"});
