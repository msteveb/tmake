fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tmake.html#symlink-targets","fragment":"symlink targets\ntmake normally uses stat() to validate that the targets of rules were created,\nand to determine the modification time of those targets. However if a target\nis a symlink, lstat() should be used instead. This is especially notable\nif the target is a dangling symlink. The -symlink flag indicates to tmake that the\ntarget is a symlink.\nNote that if a rule has multiple targets, lstat() is used on all targets.\nThis will normally be ok, even if only one of the targets is a symlink as lstat()\nwill return the same as stat() in this case.\n(Is there a case to always use lstat() on targets?)\n"});
