Most settings are still hard-coded here.\nCreate settings.conf and include/polarssl/autoconf.h\nModify include/polarssl/config.h to include autoconf.h (to avoid overwriting current version)\ntmake can build either static lib or shared lib\nCreated polarsslwrap based on axtlswrap\nTest directory uses code generation. scripts/generate_code.pl was hard to work with\nbecause it wanted to generate output in the current dir.\nI changed it slightly to take the full path to the target on the command line.\n\n\nAbout 2 seconds for tmake\nAbout 4.5 seconds for cmake\n\n"});
