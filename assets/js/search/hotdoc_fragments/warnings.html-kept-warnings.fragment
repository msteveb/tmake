How to get those warnings without cleaning and rerunning the build?\nOne innovative feature of tmake is that it saves any build warnings (stderr output)\nin the build cache and can redisplay those warnings with 'tmake --warnings'.\nThe --warnings options tells tmake to perform the build as\nnormal, but for each target that is up-to-date, if any warnings\nwere previously captured, the build message and warnings are displayed\nas though command were being rerun (although it isn't). For example,\nconsider a build of lua 5.3.2 ported to\ntmake.\nThis can be very useful with the \"quickfix\" feature to jump to errors from within the vi/vim editor.\n"});
