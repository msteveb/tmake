First a normal build.\nNow modify one file and explore the causation chain.\nWe see that both api.o and test-apio depend on api.h (through dynamic dependency scanning)\nand these dependencies cause api.o and test-api.o to be rebuilt. Next we see that libapi.a\ndepends on api.o and so it is rebuilt. And finally we see that test-api depends on both\ntest-api.o and libapi.a and at least one has changed, so it is rebuilt.\nThe causation chain is shown for each built target from the top level target that caused\nit to be built (in this case the default target, all). This can be different if a specific target is\ngiven.\n"});
